## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it as soon as possible. Here’s how to proceed:

1. **Email Me**: Send an email to [fnabinash@gmail.com] with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report for adof." In your message, include:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any potential impact or risk you believe the vulnerability may present.

2. **Security-Only Repository**: Do not open a GitHub issue to discuss vulnerabilities, as this may expose the vulnerability to the public before it’s fixed.

3. **Encryption**: If you prefer encrypted communication, please reach out to us, and we’ll provide a public PGP key.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with you to address and resolve the issue promptly.

## Security Practices

To help keep your usage of adof secure, please follow these best practices:

1. **Access Control**:
   - Run adof only with the necessary permissions.
   - Avoid running adof with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary.

2. **Sensitive Data Handling**:
   - Avoid tracking or deploying files that contain sensitive information, like passwords or personal keys.
   - If you do need to track sensitive files, use adof’s planned encryption features to protect their contents.

3. **Authentication**:
   - When linking adof to a GitHub repository, ensure that your credentials or tokens are secure and have the appropriate access scope.
   - Rotate any tokens used with adof regularly, especially if you use automated tasks like `auto_update`.

4. **Updates**:
   - Enable auto-updates to ensure you’re always using the latest, most secure version of adof.
   - Regularly check the release notes for security patches and new features.

5. **Reporting Other Issues**:
   - For non-security issues, like bugs or feature requests, feel free to open an issue in the GitHub repository.
   - For further assistance, please contact me at [fnabinash@gmail.com].

## Security Response Process

Upon receiving a security report, we will follow these steps:

1. Acknowledge receipt of the report within 48 hours and begin an internal investigation.
2. Work to identify and implement a fix for the issue.
3. Test the fix to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new vulnerabilities.
4. Release a patch or update if necessary, and credit the reporter if they wish to be acknowledged.

// auto_update - to automatically update when there is changes
//      - args
//          - then can time limit like 1 hour or 1 min or 10 min to periodically check for updates
//          and when there is upate sync the changes
//          - also have option to disable the auto_update if they want to
//
// deploy - copy all the dot files from GitHub and store in the local machine at perfect places
//      - process
//          - when user runs the deploy command first fetch the files and shows a summary of all
//          files like
//              - list all the files
//              - with line count means how many lines each file contains
//              - then the file language like rust, lua, vimrc etc
//              - the file location where it going to save (also give the option to user to change
//              the file location if they want to)
//          - after this if user says yes then proceed and save files where the location it
//          indicated
//          - when a user deploy from other GitHub repo do not link it only deploy, only link when
//          user runs the deploy command
//          - then do a small animation to celebrateðŸŽ‰
//
// log - log the last changes they made
//      - parameters
//          - date - list all the changes happened that day
//          - files - list the changes that happened to that file in particular time
//          - number - list that nth changes happened to that whole .adof folder
//          - also they can give additional parameters like 1 or 2 or all or today to list the
//          changes they made
//
// commit - to list the last commit
//
// Idea - every day create a new branch with name equals to date of that day, and commit all the changes
// thorough out the day with time then on the next day commit the changes with a squash merge with
// all commits props like date time and the files that are changed, also if they can they can
// revert to previous changes made in that day or on the any day they want to
